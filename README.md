# Spray-and-Play
The NBA-Themed Paint Project is an interactive Python application that allows users to unleash their creativity by creating art pieces with an NBA theme. Users can draw using a variety of tools, colors, and effects in a basketball-inspired environment. The project integrates custom drawing mechanics, dynamic image scaling, and seamless sound effects to enhance the user experience.

## Features

### NBA-Inspired Design

### Undo/Redo and Clear Canvas
Artists can undo something they did not like, redo something they realize they liked later on in the drawing process. They can also clear the entire canvas if they wish to restart the entire art piece.
### Save/Load Canvas
Users can save their creations or load existing files for further editing.
